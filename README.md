The previous version (v1) of this app included:

* Splash Screen
* Basic Authentication with Firebase
* JSON (for marketplace items)

* Image picker

For this v2 of the app we have: 
* MVVM: this is the design pattern applied for this version of the app. 
* Fragments: ListFragment includes all the items added by the users and can be filtered with a toggle. AddFragment to add a new item. MapFragment to view all the items in Google Maps, there is also the possibility to view each markes (for sale/sold items) for each individual or just the user items. AboutUs Fragment, includes info about the app. 
* NavDrawer: the NavDrawer contains the main functionality (add item, view list, view map, about us, signout)
* Menu: in app menu to show the main functionality available in each fragment
* Swipe Left/Right functionality: Swipe left to delete an item from the list, swipe right to edit an item. Swipe also left to view the NavBar menu. 
* Splash Screen: when the app starts, the splash screen will show the app logo for 3 seconds and then will leave space to a login screen. 
* Realtime DB Firebase and Firebase Storage
* Authentication with Firebase (password, email): at the login page, the user can decide to create a new account and login by using an email address and password, the credentials will be then stored in Firebase Authentication page
* Authentication with GoogleSignIn (via Firebase): at the login page, the user can use the option to login with a Google account, the credentials will be stored in Firebase Authentication page
* CRUD + Images: for an item creation, you can add an image, change it, delete it. The images are stored in Firebase Storage. 
* Map usage with location and custom markers: This functionality uses Google Maps API

## UX/DX Approach Adopted
UX
* consistency of colours across the app, use of gradient colours for menu
* rounded icons and images create a better design 
* use of UI elements to enhance the user experience

DX
* NavDrawer functionality to navigate through fragments
* Good use of Helpers for images and swipe functionality
* MVVM with two-way data binding 

## Git approach adopted
I've worked on Android Studio with local commit (git add -A, git commit -m..), I've created a Develop Branch in Git but merged and pushed commit to main when ready.
